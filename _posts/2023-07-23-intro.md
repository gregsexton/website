My TV lags. It's driving me crazy. Whenever I touch anything, I have
to refresh. The same is true about my laptop: I find myself hitting
refresh all the time. What about my phone? Same story. And if I lose
the network? Don't get me started on that.

Why can't it just work? Why do I have to refresh? Ever? Everything is
connected these days. Everything should be kept in sync at all times.
We have the hardware to do it, so why don't we?

The answer is simple. We simply don't have the tools to do it. To keep
things in sync the client would have to send updates to the server,
the server would have to do the same with its services and eventually
circle back to the client. That's a lot of updates! It's a sea of
updates!  And unfortunately, we don't have the tools navigate that
sea.

## Messages

Our industry is obsessed with messages. You can find all sorts of
tools to manipulate, compose/compress/archive/etc... streams of
messages. But messages are just a mean to an end. Of course, any app
using the network will have to send messages at some point. But if
your strategy involves sending messages from point A to point B, while
trying to devise the logic to update your state, you are going to get
it wrong. Why?  Because changing your state is tough. It's always been
tough. It's called cache invalidation.

## Cache invalidation (aka: the programmer's nightmare)

Imagine you are the one writing the code that invalidates the
caches. So what can you do? Well, there isn't much to do ... and
that's where the problem lies.

To effectively program the cache invalidation logic, you need to hold
all the possible state of the program in your head. In a distributed
system, the problem multiplies, as you have to manage states across
multiple machines.

Clearly, this is an impossible task, and that's why cache invalidation
has such a bad reputation. So what's the solution? The solution is to
think about the problem differently.

## The Magic of Spreadsheets

A long time ago ... in a galaxy far far away (in the 70s that is),
spreadsheets were invented. Spreadsheets were probably the first
instance of reactive programming, with one limitation: the program's
state was made of rows and columns and was not meant to grow
dynamically (the program cannot create new columns or rows at
runtime).

So, how do we 'program' a spreadsheet? We do this by writing
formulas. These formulas serve to form connections between cells. The
distinguishing feature of this programming style is that a formula is
declarative. We don't need to specify which cells require updating, or
what happens if two cells are altered simultaneously, and so on. These
details are left to the runtime. Our primary concern is the
relationship between cells, not how they update. This is the essence
of reactive programming.

Let's take another, more recent, example. Ever heard of React.js?
Traditional UI development used to involve manually updating the UI
state in response to user events. Of course, when the App was not
updating the way it should, it was impossible to understand what lead
to this corrupt state and it was therefore impossible to fix.

React.js addressed this by embracing reactive programming. The library
automatically manages when and how updates are made. So how are
React.js and spreadsheets linked? Both encourage you to operate under
the assumption that time is frozen. Whether in React or in a
spreadsheet, you construct your logic based on the premise that the
state will not change. Why? Because deciding what to do when the app
updates is not your job, that is the job of the runtime.

And this why reactive programming is such a powerful paradigm. By
removing time from the equation, we simplify the problem
dramatically. How could there be corrupt state when there is no state
to corrupt in the fist place? You just focus on what matters. The
logic of your application. The hard (and uninteresting) part will be
dealt with for you.

Now let's dream a little. Picture a spreadsheet engine that isn't
confined to the strictures of rows and columns, or a version of
React.js that isn't just tied to UI; picture a reactive programming
language that can be utilized as freely as any other language to
construct anything. Furthermore, envision it as a solution to model
distributed systems, where state can reside on various machines across
a network. What would a language like that look like?
  
## Conceiving SKIP

Regardless of the chosen method, to run an efficient reactive program,
some form of caching is needed. Because the efficiency of the model is
essentially dependent on the extent to which it reuses previously
computed results. The crux of the issue, or "the million-dollar
question," is whether copying is required when inserting or retrieving
an object from the cache. If the answer is 'no,' designing a reactive
system is simple. If the answer is 'yes,' the game changes
dramatically.

With copying, all we need to do is to keep track of the graph of
dependencies. Concretely, we need to know that we needed object X and
Y to build Z, so that if X or Y were to change at any point in time,
we would know to recompute Z. Without copying, things are more
complicated, because there needs to be immutability guarantees on the
objects involved. If an object in the cache is mutable, it could be
altered unknowingly, resulting in an undebuggable nightmare.

### Limitations of Existing Languages

Mainstream programming languages like Java, Python, or C++ don't
provide the immutability guarantees needed for reactive
programming. Although they do have some notion of immutability, like
`const`, it's insufficient. 'Const' guarantees that a function won't
modify an object, but it doesn't guarantee that no one else holds a
mutable reference to the object. So how can we get those guarantees we
need?

#### Option 1: A Purely Functional Approach

One way around this is to use a purely functional programming
language, which doesn't have this problem because everything is
immutable. However, this approach can lead to complications when
maintaining state, because purely functional programs need monads to
represent state. For those unfamiliar with the concept, monads involve
"threading" state. This means that rather than directly altering an
object, each function within the monad receives the present state of
the world as input. The function must then return the new
world state, which it passes on to the subsequent function, and so on.

Unfortunately, This is a direct contrast to the incremental nature
that we seek in reactive programming.  In a reactive program, our aim
is to maintain the independence of individual states. In practical
terms, if states A and B are unrelated, we don't wish to have to
recalculate B when A changes. The problem is, if we formulated the
logic of A and B using the monad, any change in A will automatically
result in a recalculation of B, which directly contradicts our goal.

#### Option 2: Adding a Type System to an Existing Language

Another approach involves adding a type system to an existing language
to provide the necessary immutability guarantees. Unfortunately, this
approach yields a language that is completely incompatible with the
original one. For instance, adding a type system to Java, resulting in
'Immutable Java,' creates a language that cannot interact efficiently
with Java due to incompatible mutability guarantees. That's because
when 'Immutable Java' tries to call 'Java', we don't know what objects
that were supposed to be immutable could have been modified. The same
is true the other way around. If 'Java' calls into 'Immutable Java',
we could be storing supposedly immutable objects into a cache when
really 'Java' was still holding a mutable version of them.

### The Need for a New Language

And that's why we need a new language. A language in which we can
modify objects directly, keeping independent pieces of state separate,
but that also provides the necessary immutability guarantees that we
need. This is why we've developed 'Skip.'
